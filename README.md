My first browser based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I learned CSS during the lockdown and made a static website using HTML + CSS.
This time i am trying to encorporate the coding part but with JavaScript in which I am fairly new but have a backgroud in C/C++ and Python. 
So learning JS while making a simple project :D.
